Local Quantum State Tomography

Experimental Simulation:
TensorCircuit-based simulation of experimental sampling (experimental samples, with noise)→ Local Quantum State Tomography→ Matrix Product State

Theoretical Simulation:
Tensor network-based simulation of sampling (theoretical samples, noise-free)→ Local Quantum State Tomography→ Matrix Product State
